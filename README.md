# K-means-and-HAC-Clustering
In this repository I have implemented both K-means and HAC clustering algorithms. You can easily create random data in the range you want and cluster them using both algorithms. What's more, you are able to see which algorithm works faster on a certain dataset. Hope you'll like it.
